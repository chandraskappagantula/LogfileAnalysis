# logfile_analysis
GUI Program to analyze long log files, saving valuable coding time. Users can input information about the structure of their log files, and the program will output information in `.csv` format regarding the execution time of methods, etc. 

Output includes mean runtime, median runtime, any outliers for method execution, and a distribution showing runtimes for visual analysis. Data can also be optionally exported to a `.csv` with the click of a button. 

For an example of the visual output shown in a GUI, look at `example_output.png`.
